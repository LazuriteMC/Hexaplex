## What is Hexaplex?

Hexaplex is a colorblindness correction mod for Minecraft written for the Fabric Mod Loader.

Note: Hexaplex is still in development and thus may not have all expected features implemented. Keep an eye out for 
a release in the near future.

## What isn't Hexaplex?

Hexaplex *isn't* a shader pack or a resource pack. This means that you can run this mod alongside your favorite 
shaders and resources without conflict.

## How does it work?

Hexaplex utilizes a process called Daltonization which works by simulating what a person with a color vision 
deficiency would perceive and then corrects for this by taking the missing color information and shifting it towards 
the visible spectrum of the user's vision deficiency.

On the technical side, Hexaplex uses OpenGL shaders and applies Daltonization as a post-processing filter.
