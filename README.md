## What is Hexaplex?

Hexaplex is a colorblindness correction mod for Minecraft written for the Fabric Mod Loader.

Note: Hexaplex is still in development and thus may not have all expected features implemented. Keep an eye out for 
a release in the near future.

## What isn't Hexaplex?

Hexaplex *isn't* a shader pack or a resource pack. This means that you can run this mod alongside your favorite 
shaders and resources without conflict.

## How does it work?

Hexaplex utilizes a process called Daltonization which has the following four steps.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.** Convert the original image to one that simulates what a person with a color vision deficiency would perceive.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.** Calculate the difference between the original image and the simulated one.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**3.** Shift the color differences towards the visible spectrum of the user's vision deficiency.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**4.** Correct the original image by adding the corrected differences to it.  

On the technical side, Hexaplex uses OpenGL shaders and applies Daltonization as a post-processing filter.
